# Ryan's Art Journey
I have been a very analytical computer programmer since I was 8 years old. In 2024 at age 31 I began an internship doing art therapy, which started me on a quest to re-integrate my creative side. I wanted to document what that journey has been like.

For my internship interview at an art therapy nonprofit I was asked to do an intake exercise that all clients are given. The activity is simply, "Draw a picture of a person in the rain." This is used as a sort of baseline for comparison to future art pieces.

Here was my interview piece:

(Spoiler: I wrote [an essay](https://ryanclewis.substack.com/p/whispers-of-my-vanished-twin) exploring what I believe to be the great significance of the above piece.)

I was hired as an intern and began doing art on my own in order to get more comfortable with the materials. But as I did this, I found myself also benefitting from the art exercises. It's as if the art allowed me to explore and process things I couldn't put into words. As I did this, I realized I had suppressed LOTS AND LOTS of anxiety over the years. The following progression of pieces was me working through my anxiety over the course of ~6 months.

At first I wasn't able to draw forms at all. Just strokes. An example, a rather gross and formless piece attempting to represent how my inner world felt:

After a few weeks of this I began to be able to draw very simple forms. Here is a Noah's Ark type image representing the sense of "holding on for dear life in the chaos":

Soon I was able to differentiate different aspects of my inner world and see how they were different:

After this I entered a LONG phase of fixation on duality:

Here the sense of duality is beginning to integrate with the ability to differentiate different aspects of the mind:

At some point this began integrating with my religious and existential beliefs. As I see things, Christ is the focal point of all. Duality is a pair of hierarchies that always converges at a crux, and Christ is inevitably at the center of that crux. The seed, the center, the crossover point, etc:

Here was a mindless attempt to just let my arms move in lines, arcs, and circles:

Afterward I was in a lot of pain, so I did it again but I "allowed my body to be in charge" (I can't describe what I mean by that, I just felt it) and here was the result. I was not looking at the page and I was not attempting to draw any form. As far as I'm concerned, this just emerged from pure somatic experience:

Around this time my anxiety began calming down as I began better integrating my body and my mind. From there I started exploring early childhood feelings, which manifested as things like this (Daniel Tiger [wondering why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8ZQe-aSsk8) he's different from everyone else):

Around this time I stopped feeling the "need" to do art as therapy for myself. I felt more integrated and felt at peace understanding myself and having the ability to resolve my emotional and somatic issues. I stopped doing much art for a couple months.

At this point I began feeling safe using art to calmly explore my inner world on a symbolic/aesthetic level. (Up until this point, art-making had always been an intense and anxiety-inducing activity.) Here is a simple landscape. I challenged myself to try doing my "warm color blending" with merely construction paper and no scissors:

Duality and blending of warm colors was still the primary feature in most of the stuff I made. Here is a piece I did when I finished re-reading the Harry Potter books over the Christmas break, representing the image in my head of these dramatic duels between Harry and Voldemort:

Up to this point I had not bothered to learn any technique or theory, but I was slowly becoming interested in that side of things. I began making simple attempts at introducing perspective:

I began using quick sketches in place of journaling. Instead of tryng to translate my thoughts and feelings into paragraphs of words, I would do a rough 10 minute pencil sketch. This allowed for better integration between thoughts, feelings, and somatics. Usually I would start by holding a pencil in each hand and scribbling mindlessly, focusing on somatic experience. Then I would trace out shapes and find some sort of meaningful coherent image. Frequently I gravitated to zoomed-out perspectives of land and sky with colors representing dusk, twilight, sunset, etc.

One frequent theme was a sense of combining small and large scales, as seen in the piece below. It is simultaenously a zoomed-in view of a small cairn (i.e. a pile of rocks marking a hiking trail), but also a zoomed-out cosmic tornado at the death of Christ on the cross. Often I found myself captivated by symbolic resonances between things like this, as well as the mixture of feelings associated with the different scales. In this case, the zoomed-in scale of the cairn feels calm to me while the zoomed-out scale feels intense. Sitting with the combination of these things allows me to gently sort out my fragmented inner world.
